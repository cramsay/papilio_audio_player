Using myFile.read in ISR worked for a few seconds (consistiently).
Then it would block and only forcing TMRINTER to low would resume.
Some digging revealed that this was because the way the SD card is
used. AFAIK, blocks of data are read from the sD card at once (i.e. many bytes)
- this takes 1-2 ms. Then the read() function can return the cached bytes from the
previous call.
The initial block is fetched when skipping past the first 80 bytes in setup().
When the next block is fetched, the interrupt stalls.
So, I need something like a queue of samples which is pre-emptively loaded outside
the interrupt.
